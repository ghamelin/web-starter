        <p class="text sect--text">This website was created as an alternate means of providing an answer to the question: What is the reason we should
          fear Artificial Intelligence? Presented as a thought experiment, it is designed to guide the user through a series
          of scenarios in order to help the user draw their own conclusion. The experiment is based on the famous Trolley
          Problem originally presented by philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967. It presents a hypothetical scenario and asks
          the participant to make a decision based on the given information. The exercise helps highlight the ethics of our
          actions.</p>

        <p class="text sect--text">For this experiment you will be playing the role of a Data-entry Specialist. Imagine for a moment that you have recently
          been hired by a Vehicle Automation company named "Ato" The company specializes in developing AI Learning Systems,
          and have recently built anew Learning System, designed to help self driving cars better navigate roadways.
          <br/> Before a system can be integrated into the real world it must be tested on its ability to solve problems, correctly.
          If the system is incorrect it must be corrected in order to "learn" how to solve similar problems in the future.
          This process is repeated until the computer not only gets the right answer, but until it cannot get it wrong.

          This is where you come in. Ato hired you as a Data-entry/AI System Trainer.Your job is simple, you will be presented with
          the same problem that was given to the computer. You will be given all the same information that was given to the
          computer as well as any additional information the computer gathered while solving the problem. The system will
          then make a decision to steer the car to either the "Left" or the "Right". Based on the information presented simply tell if the computer was correct (green button), incorrect (red button), or if you have no opinion (grey button). The computer will then system will then record your response into its database for use in solving other problems. Let's get started..
